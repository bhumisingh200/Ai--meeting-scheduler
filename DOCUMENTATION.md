# Meeting Scheduler AI Agent – Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The Meeting Scheduler AI Agent is an intelligent system designed to simplify the process of organizing meetings. It uses Generative AI concepts to understand user input, analyze availability, and recommend suitable meeting times efficiently.

This project demonstrates the practical application of GenAI in real-world scheduling problems.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Coordinating meetings manually is time-consuming and often leads to scheduling conflicts, especially when multiple participants are involved. There is a need for an automated solution that can intelligently handle availability, preferences, and confirmations.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution
The Meeting Scheduler AI Agent acts as a virtual assistant that:
- Collects meeting requirements
- Processes participant availability
- Suggests optimal time slots
- Confirms the final schedule

The agent minimizes human effort while improving accuracy and efficiency.

## 4. System Components
The system consists of the following major components:

- **User Interaction Layer**  
  Accepts input through chat or form-based interfaces.

- **AI Processing Module**  
  Uses Generative AI for intent understanding and decision-making.

- **Scheduling Engine**  
  Matches availability and resolves time conflicts.

- **Calendar Integration Layer**  
  Enables future integration with external calendar services.

## 5. Workflow
1. User provides meeting details (participants, date range, duration).
2. The agent gathers availability information.
3. AI processes inputs and identifies feasible slots.
4. The best meeting time is suggested.
5. User confirmation finalizes the schedule.

## 6. Applications
- Academic group meetings
- Corporate team scheduling
- Online interviews
- Project discussions

---

## 7. Limitations
- Currently operates on assumed availability
- No real-time calendar sync
- No automated notifications

---

## 8. Future Scope
- Integration with Google and Outlook calendars
- Email and reminder notifications
- Voice-based meeting scheduling
- Priority-based conflict handling

---

## 9. Conclusion
The Meeting Scheduler AI Agent highlights how Generative AI can automate everyday tasks. This project serves as a foundation that can be extended into a fully functional smart scheduling assistant.
